Welcome to issue 24 of objc.io. This month is all about audio.

We already featured two issues about [photos](/issues/21-camera-and-photos/) and [video](/issues/23-video/) this year, so it follows that this month's issue completes our media series with the missing piece: audio.

Jack Schaedler recently wrote a fantastic [introduction to signal processing](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/index.html), and he opens this issue with an article explaining the concepts behind the "Hello World!" of audio processing apps: [tracking the pitch of a monophonic musical performance](/issues/24-audio/audio-dog-house/). (The beautiful illustrations are his work too!)

Next up, Chris writes about [functional signal processing with Swift](/issues/24-audio/functional-signal-processing/), and Aaron looks at the topic of audio from a different perspective: [sound design for products](/issues/24-audio/sound-design/). Finally, if you're new to the sometimes confusing multitude of audio frameworks on Apple's platforms, Daniel and Florian provide a [high-level API overview](/issues/24-audio/audio-api-overview/).

Best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
