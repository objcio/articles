Welcome to issue 24 of objc.io. This month is all about audio.

After we already had two issues about [photos](/issue-21) and [video](/issue-23) this year, this month's issue completes this series about media with the missing piece: audio. 

Jack Schaedler recently wrote a fantastic [introduction to signal processing](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/index.html), and he opens this issue with an article explaining the concepts behind the "Hello World" of audio processing apps: [tracking the pitch of a monophonic musical performance](/issue-24/audio-dog-house.html). (The beautiful illustrations are his work too!)

Next up, Chris writes about [functional signal processing with Swift](/issue-24/functional-signal-processing.html), and Aaron looks at the topic of audio from a different perspective: [sound design for products](/issue-24/sound-design.html). Finally, if you're new to the sometimes confusing multitude of audio frameworks on Apple's platforms, Daniel and Florian provide a [high level API overview](/issue-24/audio-api-overview.html).

Best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
