Welcome to objc.io issue #4!

In this issue we are taking an in-depth look into Apple's model layer framework, Core Data.

Core Data is a powerful object graph management and persistence framework, which has been available on both iOS and OS X for many years. Nevertheless, even experienced developers often don't use it. Additionally, there is a lot of misleading information about Core Data on the Internet, which can confuse newcomers.

The articles in this issue provide a deeper overview of what Core Data is, how it works, and how you should use it. If you haven't worked with Core Data before, you will find the [overview][300] and the example of building a [full Core Data application][400] useful. If you're familiar with Core Data, we have several articles which cover the topics of [managed objects][200], [fetching data][600], [importing large data sets][100], and [migrations][700] (the latter is thanks to our guest writer Martin Hwasser).

Last but not least, special guest writer [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com) gives you an overview of [how he uses SQLite directly][500] in his applications, including the recently released [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co), but why you probably shouldn't. It's an interesting peek behind the scenes that shows what it takes to manually recreate what Core Data does for us.  

We wish you a successful iOS 7 launch month!

All the best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
