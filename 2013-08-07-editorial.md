Welcome to objc.io issue #3!

This issue is all about the view layer. Of course the view layer has so many aspects that we had to narrow it down to a few topics -- which are hopefully of interest to many developers -- while leaving tons of other interesting stuff aside (perhaps to be addressed in a later issue?).

First, we cover some internals of how pixels actually get drawn onto the screen. Aside from it simply being fascinating to take a sneak peak at the full stack under the covers of the frameworks we use everyday, it will help application developers to make smart choices when it comes to graphic performance. Similarly, [Joe Conway](http://stablekernel.com) -- author of the [Big Nerd Ranch's iOS Programming Guide](http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/ios_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide_rd_edition_) -- takes a closer look at how scroll views take advantage of `UIView`'s architecture to get their work done.  

Balancing these topics of internals, we then dive into a series of very practical view layer details: creating custom collection view layouts (many thanks to [Ole Begemann](http://oleb.net)!), creating custom controls, and advanced Auto Layout tips and tricks.

As always, we are happy to [hear from you](mailto:mail@objc.io) with feedback, suggestions for future topics, or if you would like to contribute an article to objc.io yourself (you don't need to be a native speaker, thanks to our copy editor [Natalye](https://twitter.com/deutschbitte)).

We wish you happy reading from a very summery Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
