In this article, we will build a small but complete Core Data backed application. 
The application allows you to create nested lists; each list item can have a sub-list, allowing you to create very deep hierarchies of items.
Instead of using the Xcode template for Core Data, we will build our stack by hand, in order to fully understand what's going on.
The example code for this application is on [GitHub](https://github.com/objcio/issue-4-full-core-data-application).

### How Will We Build It?

First, we will create a `PersistentStack` object that, given a Core Data Model and a filename, returns a managed object context. Then we will build our Core Data Model. Next, we will create a simple table view controller that shows the root list of items using a fetched results controller, and add interaction step-by-step, by adding items, navigating to sub-items, deleting items, and adding undo support.

## Set Up the Stack

We will create a managed object context for the main queue. In older
code, you might see `[[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] init]`. These days,
you should use the `initWithConcurrencyType:` initializer to make it
explicit that you're using the queue-based concurrency model:

    - (void)setupManagedObjectContext
    {
        self.managedObjectContext = 
             [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyType:NSMainQueueConcurrencyType];
        self.managedObjectContext.persistentStoreCoordinator = 
            [[NSPersistentStoreCoordinator alloc] initWithManagedObjectModel:self.managedObjectModel];
        NSError* error;
        [self.managedObjectContext.persistentStoreCoordinator 
             addPersistentStoreWithType:NSSQLiteStoreType
                          configuration:nil
                                    URL:self.storeURL 
                                options:nil 
                                  error:&error];
        if (error) {
            NSLog(@"error: %@", error);
        }
        self.managedObjectContext.undoManager = [[NSUndoManager alloc] init];
    }

It's important to check the error, because this will probably fail a
lot during development. When you change your data model, Core Data detects this and will
not continue. You can also pass in options to instruct Core Data about
what to do in this case, which Martin explains thoroughly in his article
about [migrations][700]. Note that the
last line adds an undo manager; we will need this later. On iOS, you
need to explicitly add an undo manager, whereas on Mac it is there by
default.

This code creates a really simple Core Data Stack: one managed object
context, which has a persistent store coordinator, which has one
persistent store. [More complicated setups][310] are possible; the most
common is to have multiple managed object contexts (each on a
separate queue).

## Creating a Model

Creating a model is simple, as we just add a new file to our project, choosing the
Data Model template (under Core Data). This model file will get compiled to a
file with extension `.momd`, which we will load at runtime to
create a `NSManagedObjectModel`, which is needed for the persistent store. The
source of the model is simple XML, and in our experience, you typically won't
have any merge problems when checking it into source control. 
It is also possible to create a managed object model in code, if you
prefer that.

Once you create the model, you can add an `Item` entity with two
attributes: `title`, which is a string, and `order`, which is an integer.
Then, you add two relationships: `parent`, which
relates an item to its parent, and `children`, which is a to-many
relationship. Set the relationships as the inverse of one another, which means
that if you set `a`'s parent to be `b`, then `b` will have `a` in its children
automatically. 

Normally, you could even use ordered relationships, and leave out the
`order` property entirely. However, they don't play together nicely with
fetched results controllers (which we will use later on). We would
either need to reimplement part of fetched results controllers, or
reimplement the ordering, and we chose the latter.

Now, choose *Editor > Create NSManagedObject subclass...* from the menu, and
create a subclass of `NSManagedObject` that is tied to this entity. This
creates two files: `Item.h` and `Item.m`. There is an extra category in the header
file, which we will delete immediately (it is there for legacy reasons).


### Create a `Store` Class

For our model, we will create a root node that is the start of our item
tree. We need a place to create this root node and to find it later.
Therefore, we create a simple `Store` class, that does exactly this. It
has a managed object context, and one method `rootItem`.
In our app delegate, we will find this root item at launch
and pass it to our root view controller. As an optimization, you can
store the object id of the item in the user defaults, in order to look it up even
faster:

    - (Item*)rootItem
    {
        NSFetchRequest* request = [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityName:@"Item"];
        request.predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"parent = %@", nil];
        NSArray* objects = [self.managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:request error:NULL];
        Item* rootItem = [objects lastObject];
        if (rootItem == nil) {
            rootItem = [Item insertItemWithTitle:nil 
                                          parent:nil 
                          inManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext];
        }
        return rootItem;
    }


Adding an item is mostly
straightforward. 
However, we have to set the `order` property to be
larger than any of the existing items with that parent. The invariant we
will use is
that the first child has an `order` of 0, and every subsequent child has an
`order` value that is 1 higher.
We create a custom method on the `Item` class where we
put the logic:

    + (instancetype)insertItemWithTitle:(NSString*)title
                                 parent:(Item*)parent
                 inManagedObjectContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)managedObjectContext
    {
        NSUInteger order = parent.numberOfChildren;
        Item* item = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:self.entityName
                                                   inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];
        item.title = title;
        item.parent = parent;
        item.order = @(order);
        return item;
    }

The number of children is a very simple method:

    - (NSUInteger)numberOfChildren
    {
        return self.children.count;
    }

To support automatic updates to our table view, we will use a fetched
results controller. A fetched results controller is an object that can
manage a fetch request with a big number of items and is the perfect
Core Data companion to a table view, as we will see in the next section:
    
    - (NSFetchedResultsController*)childrenFetchedResultsController
    {
        NSFetchRequest* request = [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityName:[self.class entityName]];
        request.predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"parent = %@", self];
        request.sortDescriptors = @[[NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKey:@"order" ascending:YES]];
        return [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequest:request 
                                                   managedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext 
                                                     sectionNameKeyPath:nil 
                                                              cacheName:nil];
    }

## Add a Table-View Backed by Fetched Results Controller

Our next step is to create the root view controller: a table view, which
gets its data from an `NSFetchedResultsController`. The fetched results
controller manages your fetch request, and if you assign a delegate, it
also notifies you of any changes in the managed object context.  In
practice, this means that if you implement the delegate methods, you can
automatically update your table view when relevant changes happen in the
data model. For example, if you synchronize in a background thread,
and then you store the changes in the database, your table view will
update automatically.


### Creating the Table View's Data Source

In our article on [lighter view controllers](/issue-1/lighter-view-controllers.html), we demonstrated how to separate out the data source of a table view. We will do exactly the same for a fetched results controller; we create a separate class `FetchedResultsControllerDataSource` that acts as a table view's data source, and by listening to the fetched results controller, updates the table view automatically.

We initialize the object with a table view, and the initializer looks like this:

    - (id)initWithTableView:(UITableView*)tableView
    {
        self = [super init];
        if (self) {
            self.tableView = tableView;
            self.tableView.dataSource = self;
        }
        return self;
    }

When we set the fetch results controller, we have to make ourselves the
delegate, and perform the initial fetch. It is easy to forget the
`performFetch:` call, and you will get no results (and no errors):

    - (void)setFetchedResultsController:(NSFetchedResultsController*)fetchedResultsController
    {
        _fetchedResultsController = fetchedResultsController;
        fetchedResultsController.delegate = self;
        [fetchedResultsController performFetch:NULL];
    }

Because our class implements the `UITableViewDataSource` protocol, we need to implement some methods for that. In these two methods we just ask the fetched results controller for the required information:

    - (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView*)tableView
    {
        return self.fetchedResultsController.sections.count;
    }
    
    - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView*)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)sectionIndex
    {
        id<NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo> section = self.fetchedResultsController.sections[sectionIndex];
        return section.numberOfObjects;
    }

However, when we need to create cells, it requires some simple steps: we
ask the fetched results controller for the right object, we dequeue a
cell from the table view, and then we tell our delegate (which will be a
view controller) to configure that cell with the object. Now, we have a
nice separation of concerns, as the view controller only has to care about
updating the cell with the model object:
    
    - (UITableViewCell*)tableView:(UITableView*)tableView 
            cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath
    {
        id object = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];
        id cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:self.reuseIdentifier
                                                 forIndexPath:indexPath];
        [self.delegate configureCell:cell withObject:object];
        return cell;
    }

### Creating the Table View Controller

Now, we can create a view controller that displays a list of items using
the class we just created. In the example app, we created a Storyboard,
and added a navigation controller with a table view controller. This
automatically sets the view controller as the data source, which is not
what we want. Therefore, in our `viewDidLoad`, we do the following:

    fetchedResultsControllerDataSource =
        [[FetchedResultsControllerDataSource alloc] initWithTableView:self.tableView];
    self.fetchedResultsControllerDataSource.fetchedResultsController = 
        self.parent.childrenFetchedResultsController;
    fetchedResultsControllerDataSource.delegate = self;
    fetchedResultsControllerDataSource.reuseIdentifier = @"Cell";


In the initializer of the fetched results controller data source, the
table view's data source gets set. The reuse identifier matches the one
in the Storyboard. Now, we have to implement the delegate method:

    - (void)configureCell:(id)theCell withObject:(id)object
    {
        UITableViewCell* cell = theCell;
        Item* item = object;
        cell.textLabel.text = item.title;
    }

Of course, you could do a lot more than just setting the text label, but
you get the point. Now we have pretty much everything in place for
showing data, but as there is no way to add anything yet, it looks
pretty empty.

## Adding Interactivity

We will add a couple of ways of interacting with the data. First, we
will make it possible to add items. Then we will implement the fetched
results controller's delegate methods to update the table view, and add
support for deletion and undo.

### Adding Items

To add items, we steal the interaction design from
[Clear](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/), which is high on my list
of most beautiful apps. We add a text field as the table view's header,
and modify the content inset of the table view to make sure it stays
hidden by default, as explained in Joe's [scroll view
article](/issue-3/scroll-view.html). As always, the full code is on github, but
here's the relevant call to inserting the item, in `textFieldShouldReturn`:

    [Item insertItemWithTitle:title 
                       parent:self.parent
       inManagedObjectContext:self.parent.managedObjectContext];
    textField.text = @"";
    [textField resignFirstResponder];

### Listening to Changes

The next step is making sure that your table view inserts a row for the
newly created item. There are several ways to go about this, but we'll use
the fetched results controller's delegate method:

    - (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController*)controller
       didChangeObject:(id)anObject
           atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath
         forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type
          newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)newIndexPath
    {
        if (type == NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert) {
            [self.tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:@[newIndexPath]
                                  withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
        }
    }

The fetched results controller also calls these methods for deletions,
changes, and moves (we'll implement that later). If you have multiple
changes happening at the same time, you can implement two more methods
so that the table view will animate everything at the same time. For
simple single-item insertions and deletions, it doesn't make a difference,
but if you choose to implement syncing at some time, it makes everything
a lot prettier:

    - (void)controllerWillChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController*)controller
    {
        [self.tableView beginUpdates];
    }
    
    - (void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController*)controller
    {
        [self.tableView endUpdates];
    }

#### Using a Collection View

It's worth noting that fetched results controllers are not at all
limited to table views; you can use them with any kind of view. Because
they are index-path-based, they also work really well with
collection views, although you unfortunately have to jump through some
minor hoops in order to make it work perfectly, as a collection view
doesn't have a `beginUpdates` and `endUpdates` method, but rather a single
method `performBatchUpdates`. To deal with this, you can collect all the
updates you get, and then in the `controllerDidChangeContent`, perform
them all inside the block. Ash Furrow wrote an example of [how you could
do this](https://github.com/AshFurrow/UICollectionView-NSFetchedResultsController).

#### Implementing Your Own Fetched Results Controller

You don't have to use `NSFetchedResultsController`. In fact, in a lot of
cases it might make sense to create a similar class that works
specifically for your application.  What you can do is subscribe to the 
`NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification`. You then get a
notification, and the `userInfo` dictionary will contain a list of the
changed objects, inserted objects, and deleted objects. Then you can
process them in any way you want.

### Passing Model Objects Around

Now that we can add and list items, it's time to make sure we can make
sub-lists. In the Storyboard, you can create a segue by dragging from a
cell to the view controller. It's wise to give the segue a name, so that
it can be identified if we ever have multiple segues originating from
the same view controller.

My pattern for dealing with segues looks like this: first, you try to
identify which segue it is, and for each segue you pull out a separate
method that prepares the destination view controller:

    - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue*)segue sender:(id)sender
    {
        [super prepareForSegue:segue sender:sender];
        if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:selectItemSegue]) {
            [self presentSubItemViewController:segue.destinationViewController];
        }
    }
    
    - (void)presentSubItemViewController:(ItemViewController*)subItemViewController
    {
        Item* item = [self.fetchedResultsControllerDataSource selectedItem];
        subItemViewController.parent = item;
    }

The only thing the child view controller needs is the item. From the
item, it can also get to the managed object context.
We get the selected item from our data source (which looks up
the table view's selected item index and fetches the correct item from the
fetched results controller). It's as simple as that.

One pattern that's unfortunately very common is having the managed
object context as a property on the app delegate, and then always accessing
it from everywhere. This is a bad idea. If you ever want to use a
different managed object context for a certain part of your view
controller hierarchy, this will be very hard to refactor,
and additionally, your code will be a lot more difficult to test.

Now, try adding an item in the sub-list, and you will probably get a
nice crash. This is because we now have two fetched results controllers,
one for the topmost view controller, but also one for the root view
controller. The latter one tries to update its table view, which is
offscreen, and everything crashes. The solution is to tell our data
source to stop listening to the fetched results controller delegate methods:

    - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
    {
        [super viewWillAppear:animated];
        self.fetchedResultsControllerDataSource.paused = NO;
    }
    
    - (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated
    {
        [super viewWillDisappear:animated];
        self.fetchedResultsControllerDataSource.paused = YES;
    }

One way to implement this inside the data source is setting the fetched
results controller's delegate to nil, so that no updates are received
any longer. We then need to add it after we come out of `paused` state:

    - (void)setPaused:(BOOL)paused
    {
        _paused = paused;
        if (paused) {
            self.fetchedResultsController.delegate = nil;
        } else {
            self.fetchedResultsController.delegate = self;
            [self.fetchedResultsController performFetch:NULL];
            [self.tableView reloadData];
        }
    }

The `performFetch` will then make sure your data source is up to date.

Of course, a nicer implementation would be to not set the delegate to nil, but
instead keep a list of the changes that happened while in paused state,
and update the table view accordingly after you get out of paused state.

So, what you would do is:

	- (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller
	didChangeSection:(id <NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo>)sectionInfo
			   atIndex:(NSUInteger)sectionIndex 
			   forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type
	{
		//(save changes in some collection object)
		return;
	}

	- (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller 
		didChangeObject:(id)anObject
		   atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath 
		forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type
		  newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)newIndexPath
	{
		//(save changes in some collection object)
		return;
	}


	- (void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller {

		if (self.tableView.window == nil) {
			[self.tableView reloadData];
			return;	
		}

		//	process updates	with animations
		...
	}

The need for the collection object that keeps the changes is due to possible 
race-condition - table view can come onscreen in-between the 
delegate calls and thus you would miss previous data changes, if not saved.

There's a [category on the UICollectionView](https://github.com/radianttap/UICollectionView-NSFetchedResultsController)
by Aleksandar Vacić that does all this for you. You use it like this:

	- (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller 
	didChangeSection:(id <NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo>)sectionInfo
			   atIndex:(NSUInteger)sectionIndex 
			   forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type
	{

		[self.collectionView addChangeForSection:sectionInfo 
							atIndex:sectionIndex 
							forChangeType:type];
	}

	- (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller 
		didChangeObject:(id)anObject
		   atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath 
		   forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type
		  newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)newIndexPath
	{

		[self.collectionView addChangeForObjectAtIndexPath:indexPath 
						forChangeType:type 
						newIndexPath:newIndexPath];
	}

	- (void)controllerDidChangeContent:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller {

		[self.collectionView commitChanges];
	}

With this, you don't have to think is the view visible or not – `commitChanges` will 
do the right thing in either case and there are no additional checks you need 
to do anywhere else in your code.

### Deletion

To support deletion, we need to take a few steps. First, we need to
convince the table view that we support deletion, and second, we need to
delete the object from core data and make sure our order invariant stays
correct.

To allow for swipe to delete, we need to implement two methods in the
data source:

         - (BOOL)tableView:(UITableView*)tableView
     canEditRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath
     {
         return YES;
     }
     
      - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView 
     commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle
      forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
         if (editingStyle == UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete) {
             id object = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath]
             [self.delegate deleteObject:object];
         }
     }

Rather than deleting immediately, we tell our delegate (the view
controller) to delete the object. That way, we don't have to share the
store object with our data source (the data source should be reusable
across projects), and we keep the flexibility to do any custom actions.
The view controller simply calls `deleteObject:` on the managed object
context.

However, there are two important problems to solve: what do we do with
the children of the item that we delete, and how do we enforce our order
variant? Luckily, propagating deletion is easy: in our data model, we
can choose *Cascade* as the delete rule for the children relationship.

For enforcing our order variant, we can override the
`prepareForDeletion` method, and update all the siblings with a higher
`order`:

    - (void)prepareForDeletion
    {
        NSSet* siblings = self.parent.children;
        NSPredicate* predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"order > %@", self.order];
        NSSet* siblingsAfterSelf = [siblings filteredSetUsingPredicate:predicate];
        [siblingsAfterSelf enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(Item* sibling, BOOL* stop)
        {
            sibling.order = @(sibling.order.integerValue - 1);
        }];
    }

Now we're almost there. We can interact with table view cells and delete
the model object. The final step is to implement the necessary code to
delete the table view cells once the model objects get deleted. In our
data source's `controller:didChangeObject:...` method we add another if
clause:

    ...
    else if (type == NSFetchedResultsChangeDelete) {
        [self.tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:@[indexPath]
                              withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
    }


### Add Undo Support

One of the nice things about Core Data is that it comes with integrated
undo support. We will add *the shake to undo* feature, and a first step
is telling the application that we can do this:

    application.applicationSupportsShakeToEdit = YES;

Now, whenever a shake is triggered, the application will ask the first
responder for its undo manager, and perform an undo. In [last month's
article](http://www.objc.io/issue-3/custom-controls.html), we saw that a
view controller is also in the responder chain, and this is exactly
what we'll use. In our view controller, we override the following two
methods from the `UIResponder` class:

    - (BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder {
        return YES;
    }
    
    - (NSUndoManager*)undoManager
    {
        return self.managedObjectContext.undoManager;
    }

Now, when a shake gesture happens, the managed object context's undo manager will get an
undo message, and undo the last change.  Remember, on iOS, a managed object context doesn't have an undo manager by default, (whereas on Mac, a newly created managed object context does have an undo manager), so we created that in the setup of the persistent
stack:

    self.managedObjectContext.undoManager = [[NSUndoManager alloc] init];

And that's almost all there is to it. Now, when you shake, you get the
default iOS alert view with two buttons: one for undoing, and one for
canceling. One nice feature of Core Data is that it automatically groups
changes. For example, the `addItem:parent` will record as one undo
action. For the deletion, it's the same. 

To make managing the undos a bit easier for the user, we can also name
the actions, and change the first lines of `textFieldShouldReturn:` to
this:

    NSString* title = textField.text;
    NSString* actionName = [NSString stringWithFormat:
        NSLocalizedString(@"add item \"%@\"", @"Undo action name of add item"), title];
    [self.undoManager setActionName:actionName];
    [self.store addItem:title parent:nil];

Now, when the user shakes, he or she gets a bit more context than just the
generic label "Undo".

### Editing

Editing is currently not supported in the example application, but is a
matter of just changing properties on the objects. For example, to
change the title of an item, just set the `title` property and you're
done. To change the parent of an item `foo`, just set the `parent` property
to a new value `bar`, and everything gets updated: `bar` now has `foo`
in its `children`, and because we use fetched results controllers the
user interface also updates automatically.

### Reordering

Reordering cells is also not possible in the sample application, but
is mostly straightforward to implement. Yet, there is one caveat: if you
allow user-driven reordering, you will update the `order` property in
the model, and then get a delegate call from the fetched results
controller (which you should ignore, because the cells have already
moved). This is explained in the
[`NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008228-CH1-SW14)

## Saving

Saving is as easy as calling `save` on the managed object context.
Because we don't access that directly, we do it in the store. The only
hard part is when to save. Apple's sample code does it in
`applicationWillTerminate:`, but depending on your use case it could
also be in `applicationDidEnterBackground:` or even while your app is
running.

## Discussion

In writing this article and the example application, I made an initial
mistake: I chose to not have an empty root item, but instead let all
the user-created items at root level have a `nil` parent. This caused a
lot of trouble: because the `parent` item in the view controller could
be `nil`, we needed to pass the store (or the managed object context)
around to each child view controller. Also, enforcing the order
invariant was harder, as we needed a fetch request to find an item's
siblings, thus forcing Core Data to go back to disk. Unfortunately,
these problems were not immediately clear when writing the code, and
some only became clear when writing the tests. When rewriting the code,
I was able to move almost all code from the `Store` class into the
`Item` class, and everything became a lot cleaner.
